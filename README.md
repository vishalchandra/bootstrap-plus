==============

Bootstrap is quite useful but like many frameworks sometimes you cannot do what you want to do within that framework. 
The code snippets here help fulfill some needs which cannot be met by bootstrap.

1. Compact-Gutter-Width: Bootstrap addon for creating rows with compact or reduced or custom gutter widths (the gap between columns). Works in tablet and desktop mode.
                           
2. Suggest other add-ons for bootstrap
